      This past June saw <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-07-01/news/40288227_1_june-rain-wettest-inch">more rainfall</a> than any June on record in Philadelphia. With July starting off with even more precipitation, we wanted to look at what times of the day receive the most rain. Why does it seem to start pouring when we're leaving the office around five or six o'clock?
    </p>
    <p>The Philadelphia Water Department maintains a network of 24 rain gauges that are spread throughout the City. We have analyzed data from 1990 to 2013 and tallied the total amount of rain that has fallen in each hour of each month.

        Note: During times of snowfall, the perciptation amounts recorded by the rain gauges do not represent the amount of snowfall. Once the snow melts, the rain gauges record the amount of melted snow in the gauge.
